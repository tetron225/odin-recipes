    <h2>Savory and delicious pajeon is a perfect crowd pleaser with any Korean meal. Learn how to make “Haemul Pajeon” (Korean seafood and green onion pancakes). It’s so easy!</h2>
    <h1></h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>Pajeon is a variety of Korean pancake that uses green onion / scallion as a prominent ingredient. So it is translated as green onion pancakes or scallion pancakes.

        Other than green onions, it is also made with homemade or pre-made Korean pancake mix, water, egg and commonly, a mix of seafood.
        
        The Korean name for this seafood and green onion pancakes is Haemul Pajeon (해물파전). I normally just add in squid / calamari and prawns, but you can throw in any seafood kinds you like here such as clams, mussels, and oysters etc.  </h3>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h1></h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup plain flour, sifted</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 & 1/8 tsp fine salt</li>
        <li>1 & 1/8 tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 & 1/8 tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1 cup icy cold water or sparkling water</li>
        <li>12 green onion tops (green part), cleaned and cut lengthways to fit your skillet</li>
        <li>100g / 3.5 ounces calamari, cleaned and cut into little finger sized pieces</li>
        <li>100g / 3.5 ounces prawns, cleaned and cut into smaller pieces</li>
        <li>A few sprinkles ground black pepper, to marinate the seafood</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>6 Tbsp cooking oil</li>
    
    </ul> 

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare a medium size bowl and add flour, cornstarch, sea salt, garlic powder, onion powder and the icy cold water. Whisk it well. Transfer the pancake batter into a measuring jug (for easier pouring).</li>
        <li> Preheat the frying pan on high heat until the bottom of the pan is well heated. Add cooking oil (approx. 3 Tbsp) and ensure the oil is spread all the way around the pan. (Watch out for oil splash.)

        </li>
        <li>Wait until the temperature of the oil is ready to cook (about 1 minute). To check, drop a bit of pancake batter into the pan. If it sizzles, it is ready. Reduce the heat to medium high heat. Pour out the pancake batter (from step 1, use just less than half a cup) and spread it evenly and thinly around the pan.</li>
        <li>Place 6 green onion tops on the pancake batter parallel to each other and pour out a little bit of the pancake batter onto and between the green onions, filling the gaps. Reduce the heat to medium.

        </li>
        <li>Place some calamari, prawns and red chilies (optional) sparingly on top of the green onions.</li>
        <li>Use a spoon to drizzle half of the beaten egg over the top of the pancake. While cooking, move the pancake in a circular motion from time to time, so the pancake doesn’t get stuck to the pan.</li>
        <li>Turn the pancake over when you see the top of the pancake partially cooked. (This makes it easy to turn the pancake. It takes around 4 minutes). Add more cooking oil around the edges of the pancake circle if necessary to release. Press the pancake with the spatula a couple of times to sizzle and make it crispy. Cook for another 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the heat off and transfer onto a plate or a cutting board.</li>
